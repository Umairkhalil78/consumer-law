<h2>Definition and Scope</h2>
<p>Consumer law, often referred to as consumer protection law, is a body of legal principles and statutes that aim to shield consumers from unfair practices. It covers a wide range of transactions, including the purchase of goods and services, credit transactions, and product safety..</p>

<h2>Consumer Rights</h2>
<p>Central to consumer law are the rights granted to individuals when making purchases. These rights typically include the right to accurate information about products or services, the right to choose freely, the right to be protected against hazardous goods, and the right to seek redress in case of a faulty product or service..</p>

<h2> Consumer Contracts</h2>
<p>Consumer law often regulates the terms and conditions of contracts between consumers and businesses. Standardized contracts with unfair terms, hidden fees, or misleading clauses may be deemed unenforceable. This ensures that consumers enter into agreements with full awareness and understanding.</p>

<h2>Smart Contracts and Automation</h2>
<p>One of the key elements driving the Bitcoin Bank Breaker phenomenon is the use of smart contracts. These self-executing contracts automate and enforce the terms of an agreement, eliminating the need for intermediaries like lawyers and banks. By relying on code rather than human intervention, smart contracts streamline processes and reduce the risk of fraud, making transactions more efficient and secure.</p>
